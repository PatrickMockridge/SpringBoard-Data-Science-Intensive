    "The aim of this Milestone report is to be able to gain further insight into the direction of the final Capstone Project. The Data Story yielded some insight into the structure of the debate and it was revealed that both of the candidates shared much more in common than the visceral animosity between their supporters would have suggested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing and bag of words/frequency methods will begin to form the basis of how the Capstone Project should be framed. The initial hypothesis is that deep learning and classification techniques could be used in the Capstone to begin to fully understand the language and sentiment of this debate which could then be applied to other debates, such as the Caucus debates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many watched the Presidential debate. totally sure of what we experienced. NLP allows us to focus on different aspects of what what said with a different lens. For political speech this is a fascinating development and gives us much deeper insight and undestanding into our differences."

    "This brief foray into NLP has yielded greater predictive insight into the language used by the candidates. We can clearly see that while Trump and Clinton use similar words, the context of those words is different enough to yield insight, reflecting a different perspective of the targetted demographics. Trump's campaign can be seen to lean towards disaffected working class males threatened by immigration with a more pessimistic view of America, whereas Clinton is targetting middle class females with a more optmistic view. This Milestone report sets the stage for the final Capstone report where these findings can be fully elaborated and expanded upon."
