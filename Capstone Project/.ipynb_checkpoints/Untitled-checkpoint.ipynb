No one really wants to ban guns, its just regulation. Still, Ill never understand why rural conservatives think you need a semi-auto for self defense in the middle of nowhere.

Semi auto is  the VAST majority of firearms on the market. Its even the most popular form of shotgun. \\nIn a self-defense scenario if you miss with a single fire then you\\'re screwed. With semi auto you have another chance as long as you still have ammo. Handguns are effective because they\\'re easy to operate, carry multiple rounds, and in a self defense scenario they\\'re very effective where as swinging around a breech load shotgun would be more of a liability.\\nAlso remember that lots of people carry a handgun with them because self-defense isn\\'t just in the home.

The idea of \"You\\'re either a liberal, or a conservative\". This is pretty common from what I\\'ve seen. The fact that there\\'s only two real parties to choose from, only helps to solidify that. Especially when those two parties must oppose each other on every issue, in order to try and draw more voters. \"We\\'re different from those other guys!\"\\nYou can have opinions and stances that do not follow the \\'party lines\\'. You can be liberal and support Trump. And you can be conservative and oppose him. This artificial drawing of lines for \\'You\\'re either on the left, or the right!\\' is what I think is the origin of strife in the US. There\\'s been some development for libertarians and green parties, but not nearly enough to broach that black-and-white thinking.\\nMost people, in my opinion, have the same overall basic goals and wants. Be happy, have a stable job, have friends, be healthy, feel safe, maybe a few more. It\\'s the method of getting there is where people differ. And people butting heads over which way is best to get there, is a big factor of conflict. The best counter to that is discussion, and some form of openness to at least consideration (if only to logically disagree with it later).\\nEnd statement - I myself respect the opinions of why or why not people support Trump, if we\\'re just talking the politicians and actions going on there. Once the discussion turns on \"I hate the other side - this is why they are bad\" - that serves no purpose except to antagonize and stir up aggression and hate for your own countrymen. It could be fighting over what kind of brand of pot or pan to use - and it would still lead to the destabilization of the country, given enough vitriol.\\n\\npermalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[â\\x80\\x93]1Glitch0 [score hidden] 7 hours agoÂ\\xa0(0 children)This is different.

We know exactly what he plans to do once in office, and the majority of the country vehemently rejects it.\\nWhat could be more unamerican than protesting a politician who has promised to do great harm to your nation despite failing to win more votes than his opponent?
